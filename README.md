Settings used for mini PC running TAP Interface
I'm using this repo to keep back-ups scripts and the crontab I set up to have my app run on start up and vnc access start on boot.
I took me alot of time to figure out how to get these things to work so I wanted to keep them here for the next time I need to figure it out.
Auto login also needs to be enabled for this stuff to work.
